## Getting Started

This project requires a working [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM (comes with Node.js)
installation. To start, clone the repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and then run `npm run dev` to launch
a local development server at [`localhost:3000`](https://localhost:3000) by default.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThejasKumar100/React-Workshop.git
cd React-Workshop
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx` and the card by modifying `src/components/ClubCard.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the files.

You'll need these IDs to refer to clubs as you develop the site.
